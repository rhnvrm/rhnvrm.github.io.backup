title: The 30 Day Trial - Day Zero
---

I don't really remember where I read about this technique called 'The 30 Day Trial' but I find it very effective. Essentially, you pick up a new thing and must not give up for the next 30 days. This approach behind it is similar to shareware like WinRAR.

My last attempt was to break my previous public `git commit` streak of 29 Days and I started on December 28 and today was Day 30.

Now, this month I'm going to try out blogging. 30 days - 30 Minutes - Daily. If I like it, I can continue after the trial; or just stop after 30 days.
