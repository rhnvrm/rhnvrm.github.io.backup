This summer I will be working on an open source project called [Apache 
Allura](https://allura.apache.org/). This software powers [SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net)
and is developed 
under the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). My mentors are 
[Dave Brondsema](http://brondsema.net) 
and [Heith Seewald](https://twitter.com/heiths) who have been guiding me along the way during the application
period and the community bonding period and I hope to have an amazing summer working
with them.

I will keep updating my progress on this blog so stay tuned!
